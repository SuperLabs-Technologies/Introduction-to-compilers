# Introduction to machine code
> In this document, we will be focusing on the x86 architecture of the intel instruction set

x86 machine code is a set of instructions that can be executed by a microprocessor that uses the x86 architecture. It consists of a series of binary digits (ones and zeros) that tell the processor what operations to perform. x86 machine code is used on most personal computers and servers, as well as on many embedded systems and mobile devices. It is a low-level programming language that is typically used in conjunction with higher-level languages like C, C++, and assembly.
